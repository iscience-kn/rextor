#' Read WEXTOR Data
#' 
#' With this function, you can easily read in your WEXTOR generated data.
#' By default, it will be exported as a "CSV" file, which stands for "comma-separated values". 
#' R has many available options of reading in this type of data, which can make it hard to navigate which one to use - especially for beginners.
#' 
#' In the [read_WEXTOR()] function, you just need to provide the `filepath`, i.e. the location of the CSV data file 
#' that you downloaded from WEXTOR. 
#' If you want, you can already decided whether to keep the first column containing a so-called validation variable, but you don't have to.
#' With no other input, rextor will keep the variable for you. 
#' You can explicitly set `keep_validation` to FALSE if you like your data neat and do not need this extra measure.
#' The usage is explained in the examples down below using the open source BiFiX data with psychological Big Five personality traits.
#' 
#' This function prepares the WEXTOR data so that it is readable by both R and you as a human.
#' It will give you your original data and also make the start and end time of each participation easier to read and work with later 
#' (by default, WEXTOR will return these values as date and time separately, cluttering your dataset).
#'
#' @param filepath Location of the WEXTOR CSV file on your computer.
#' @param keep_validation Should the validation variable from WEXTOR be kept? TRUE by default.
#' 
#' @import dplyr
#' @import readr
#'
#' @return The WEXTOR data as an R data object.
